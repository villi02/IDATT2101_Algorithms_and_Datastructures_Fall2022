The two tasks are finished as described.

Both programs work by running them without command line arguments.
Both programs start with a promt asking for user input, and will do everything automatically as long as given the correct input format

Task 1 comments:
- The code does not accept a number with more than 23 digits, but the criteria was for minimum 20, so it is still a valid solution
- must give a number and no letter as input


Task 2 comments:
- adding the words through the command line proved to be a bit of a hassle, to I added the same test data as was in the example.
-   - If you wish to test further then I suggest you add/remove any elements as per the test data so that the program works smoothly
-   - or use the infinite loop that will dynamically add the next word to the tree
- should only input text
- The program will only display the first 4 levels
