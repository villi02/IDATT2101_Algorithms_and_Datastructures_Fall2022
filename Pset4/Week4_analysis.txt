The two tasks are finished as described.



Task 1 comments:
- The code does not accept a number with more than 23 digits


Task 2 comments:
- adding the words through the command line proved to be a bit of a hassle, to I added the same test data as was in the example.
-   - If you wish to test further then I suggest you add/remove any elements as per the test data so that the program works smoothly
