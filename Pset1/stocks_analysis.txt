Practice set 1, by Vilhjalmur Arnar Vilhjalmsson

The algorithm simply iterates once through the array of values, and checks each element for two criterias. Thus the time complexity comes out to O(n)

Here are tests of the algorithm with different sizes (int microseconds):
(n = 10 000), time = 34[µs]
(n = 100 000), time = 522[µs]
(n = 1 000 000), time = 3166[µs]
(n = 10 000 000), time = 33350[µs]

As we can see here, the time duration is increased with aproximately 10x when the dataset is increased with 10x.
